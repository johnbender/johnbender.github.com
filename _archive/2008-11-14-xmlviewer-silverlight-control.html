So instead of rolling happenings into a gem, I got bored and decided to hack together some Silverlight and see what it was like. I've often said that C# is awesome for development, but that ASP.NET is not the best. The event driven model makes me want to gouge my eyes out (Page_Load, After_Load,  Post_Pre_After_Load), but that's another blog post that I've been meaning to write.

Anyhow! I wanted to try Silverlight out because your basically building a GUI app, which .NET is great for, but deploying it with the browser. Cross Platform no less! So please try it out, post what you think, and I'll get the code up on codeplex or something tomorrow if I can find the time.
