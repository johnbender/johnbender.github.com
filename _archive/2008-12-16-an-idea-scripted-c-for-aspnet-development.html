I work as a .NET consultant in New York, most often with ASP.NET and SharePoint so the frustration expressed here comes directly from experience. Outside of work I like to dabble with lots of other neat tools an one thing I've really gotten used to in web development is NOT having to compile when I make simple changes to my app. PHP, Python, and Ruby all make this very easy. And if your project is pretty small, using ASP.NET doesn't add too much over head. But that doesn't last for long

The problem is when the project gets large or you group a lot of classes/code into a single DLL and THEN have to compile them to see your changes. Even failing to mention the need to get IIS to clear its cache before anyone can see a change from the code, there's a wait time of 30 seconds to a minute depending on the size of the dll.

I hear you say, "30 seconds isn't that big of a deal", but doing a little math shows you that 30 seconds compounded maybe a hundred times (conservative) a day over the course of a week or two and you end up with hours wasted. All that time spent just waiting, doing nothing. What's worse is that you lose your focus on what you're testing. You're continuity of thought is crushed under the weight of compiling your 1 liner alteration. 

So, lots of whining without many suggestions. Well here it is: http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/Sep-29.html. That's the mono project's leader Miguel De Icaza's blog and he talks about the csharp interactive shell that came out of the mono project recently.

What I would like to see is a development mode for IIS that deals with C# in a script like fashion, using something like the aforementioned link so that we can stop compiling things while were working on them, and still get the nice quick execution we've come to expect from compiled/cached .NET assemblies in production. Faster iterations means more efficiency and less brain breaks when developing web applications. 

Right, the page might load slower when you fire up your server, but I'm tired of recompiling some huge thick dll every time I make an extremely small change.
