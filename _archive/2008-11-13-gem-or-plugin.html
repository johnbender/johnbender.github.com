So I think that my event tracking system happenings is pretty nice. Nice enough that people might want to use it for their projects. The question that I'm trying to answer is: can I roll this in to a gem so I get all the package management niceness (Dependencies, etc) that goes along with gems, or do I need to create a plugin with generators and such?

From what I've read, views are the main sticking point. It _seems_ like I could just create my Controller and Model classes and force the user to inherit from them, but what about the Views? This sounds like a job for a generator, which I am loath to create, but laziness will be the death of this little piece of code. 

Hopefully I can get off my duff and get this done. I'll post back soon when I come to a decision.
