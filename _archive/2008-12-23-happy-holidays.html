I'm not sure if anyone reads this regularly, but with that uptick in people stopping by I thought I would wish everyone a great holiday season just in case they do!

I switched the theme for the site because I was running out of tab space at the top and I will be putting up at least one new project for people to look at relatively soon. My first in erlang!

Also, if you haven't already checked it out, <a href="http://erlanguid.com">erlanguid.com</a> is up and running. Not too many members right now but I'm hoping that as time passes and I can get some good tutorials/screencasts up there about working with erlang and setting up a development environment (yaws appmods, debugging with emacs, io:format vs io_lib:format, etc). 

Again, have a great holiday and a wonderful new year!
