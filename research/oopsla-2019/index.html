<p>Java’s memory model was recently updated and expanded with new access modes. The<br>
accompanying documentation for these access modes is intended to make strong<br>
guarantees about program behavior that the Java compiler must enforce, yet the<br>
documentation is frequently unclear. This makes the intended program behavior<br>
ambiguous, impedes discussion of key design decisions, and makes it impossible<br>
to prove general properties about the semantics of the access modes. In this<br>
paper we present the first formalization of Java’s access modes. We have<br>
constructed an axiomatic model for all of the modes using the Herd modeling<br>
tool. This allows us to give precise answers to questions about the behavior of<br>
example programs, called litmus tests. We have validated our model using a large<br>
suite of litmus tests from existing research which helps to shed light on the<br>
relationship with other memory models. We have also modeled the semantics in Coq<br>
and proven several general theorems including a DRF guarantee, which says that<br>
if a program is properly synchronized then it will exhibit sequentially<br>
consistent behavior. Finally, we use our model to prove that the unusual design<br>
choice of a partial order among writes to the same location is unobservable in<br>
any program.</p>
