So, the reason I haven't posted in a bit is that I've been finishing up <a href="https://github.com/johnbender/happenings/tree">happenings</a> for deployment (learning capistrano), I put together a really nice <a href="https://www.hensongroup.com/usersgroups/sharepointdevelopers/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2fusersgroups%2fsharepointdevelopers%2fShared%20Documents%2fNovember%2025th%202008&FolderCTID=&View={7E84DB17-7B83-4137-8EEC-10BEE788F0AB}">presentation</a> on SharePoint basics for my user group, and also because I've been putting together a new forum!

<a href="http://erlanguid.com/">erlanguid</a> is a forum for erlang hackers, and people who want to learn to hack erlang (including myself). <a href="http://forum.trapexit.org/">Trapexit's forum</a> seems to be a secondary focus of the site, and I thought a strong board for people wanting to learn erlang and discuss their projects could really benefit the community.

Things left to do:
<ul>
        <li>Delicious Top Links Plugin - pull erlang links from delicious</li>
	<li>Digg Top Stories Plugin - pull erlang stories</li>
	<li>Link to Message Github User</li>
	<li>Github Project Info Plugin - pull project information for posts in Projects forum</li>
	<li>Initial posts - forum purpose explanations and starter info</li>
</ul>

I hope to have it mostly done by the end of this weekend, in addition to adding textile functionality via <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/">Redcloth</a> to the happenings description field. Once I get the the initial posts up, I'll start informing some people and work on the javascript in the mean time. 

Another post will be forthcoming when the forum is up and ready for consumption!
