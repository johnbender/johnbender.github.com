The primary focus of this blog will be my joining and hopefully contributing to an open source project. Along the way I'll be posting about all sorts of tech-topics (*nix, Apple, security, .NET, hardware etc etc) to keep it from getting to sparse and/or boring.
I've haven't yet chosen a project and suggestions are welcome at any time!
