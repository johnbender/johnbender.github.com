I added <a href="http://github.com/jamis/fuzzyfinder_textmate/tree/master">fuzzyfinder_textmate</a> last night to my plugins, and I was tooling around inside the script on a whim, when a relatively simple idea came to me. One which I'm sure has occurred to many VIM users: why are we still using vim script to customize VIM?

Well, doing a tiny bit of research revealed that you don't in fact have to! If you hack  python you can check out an awesome tutorial <a href="http://www.builderau.com.au/program/python/soa/Extending-Vim-with-Python/0,2000064084,339283181,00.htm">here</a>, but my example is done in Ruby.
