You can find the <a href="https://github.com/johnbender/presentation-middleware/tree/master/samples">code samples</a> and the <a href="http://johnbender.github.com/presentation-middleware">presentation slides</a> on Github and a big thanks to the fine folks at <a href="http://confreaks.com">Confreaks</a> for posting the video.
