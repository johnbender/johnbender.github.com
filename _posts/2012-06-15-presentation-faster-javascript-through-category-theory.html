I'd like to give a big "Thanks!" to the folks at <a href="http://js.la">la.js</a> for having me out, putting on a great meetup, and recording my presentation at the end of May. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/johnbender/presentation-faster-js/blob/master/samples/scratch.js">code samples</a> and the <a href="http://johnbender.github.com/presentation-faster-js">presentation slides</a> on Github.
