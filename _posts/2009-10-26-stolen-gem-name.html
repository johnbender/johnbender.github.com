[Update: Nick Quaranto was kind enough to respond to my twitter message, and the issue has been resolved. Many thanks Nick!]

So I went to publish RQuery to gem cutter but I got this lovely tidbit:

<pre>
Pushing gem to Gemcutter...
You do not have permission to push to this gem.
</pre>
<br />

I figured someone had clearly come up with a similar name and applied it to their gem so I went and searched and found:

<a href="http://gemcutter.org/gems/rquery">http://gemcutter.org/gems/rquery</a>

Needless to say I was a little bit bummed, but I thought it odd that its was just a dot one version higher than my last release, and then I noticed that the homepage link points back to none other than my page about the darn gem! 

What that hell man, gimme my gem name back!
