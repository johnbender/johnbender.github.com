This is why I love Rails:

In the commit you'll notice that there are two files that got changed. The output for the Textile, and adding the gem to the environment.rb. Other than that all I had to do was install the gem in both dev and production, and unpack it in production. 

This is certainly a short post, but I have to say that when you've used Rails enough to know exactly what to do in a given situation, that "todo" ends up being a very light undertaking. 

Make no mistake, Rails is the framework of the future.
