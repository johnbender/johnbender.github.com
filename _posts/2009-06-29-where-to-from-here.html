Been mulling over my next project after I finish a small Rails app for my friend. I'm not sure I'll have the time in the near future but here are the ideas that are competing in my head for... well literally... mind share.

Both use Erlang. <a href="http://github.com/johnbender/unraverl/tree/master">Unraverl </a>is the beginnings of a meta programming/parse transform library for Erlang. At this point it only implements before/after filters with method chains. <a href="http://github.com/johnbender/grove/tree/master">Grove</a> is a JSON Query to set comprehension library for use with Mnesia. 

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/johnbender/unraverl/tree/master">Unraverl</a><ol>
	<li>add partial application</li>
	<li>runtime function definition from funs</li>
        <li>add pure/impure designation attribute/checking</li>
</ol></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/johnbender/grove/tree/master">Grove</a><ol>
	<li>Make use of MochiWeb</li>
	<li>Rework the JSON query structure</li>
        <li>Move JSON Query to Set Comprehension logic out into separate module/project</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

Clearly Unraverl is the most flashy, and likely the most interesting bit of hacking, but whether it becomes useful later or not remains to be seen. I still think that Being able to use Mnesia from Rails or from rich clients would be really very awesome. 

On top of those things I need to take the time to learn org-mode, and build at least one gen_server or gen_fsm based app.

Either way code will result!
