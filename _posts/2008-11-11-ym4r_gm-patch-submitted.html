As promised I submitted my ym4r google maps rails plugin <a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=22766&group_id=1716&atid=6686">patch</a>. That's pretty much the first patch I've ever submitted for anything, so here's hoping they don't come back and lambast me for my ridiculously stupid idea. 

If you look at the diff its around 5 lines but I thought it was a pretty nice little extra. I just added a :function option that lets you specify a function that you can call in javascript client side to actually render the map instead of the the default window.onload or automatic. Here's what using the option looks like 

<script src="http://gist.github.com/24087.js"></script>

and this renders as the following in the page

<script src="http://gist.github.com/24086.js"></script>

Meaning you can just call it whenever you would like. 

I added this in because I was loading 5 - 10 map divs per page and they were display=none, so it didn't make sense to send the call to Google for the map unless the user wanted to view the hidden map. Here's hoping they except the patch!
