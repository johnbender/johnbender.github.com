I started this project a long time ago to learn Ruby and never got around to making it really useful. Well I just resurrected it and I think it could be useful for people working with C. 

Basically it just does all the dirty work of taking your C methods and making them available for Ruby via a bundle file. The next step is to build out a Ruby unit test script with stubs for each of the methods in the bundle, thus making it very easy to unit test your C code. 

Check it out <a href="http://github.com/johnbender/ryc-unit-testing/tree/master">here</a>.
