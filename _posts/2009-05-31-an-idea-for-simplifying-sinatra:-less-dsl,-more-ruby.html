I've been using Sinatra quite a bit lately and its really a great way to get an application up and running. When looking at a basic Sinatra app its extremely easy to discern what code will be executing for a given route, and leaving aside the benefits this provides for reasoning about your application it also shortens ramp-up time for people new to your project's code base. Even better when you want to extend Sinatra's dsl it's pretty easy:

..code.. -http://www.sinatrarb.com/extensions.html

For the most part it's an incredibly painless and quick way to develop web applications. 

<h3>A different way</h3>

When you start to move beyond the basic examples presented on the site; Sinatra, as a consequence of the Sinatra::Base class method dsl, can be a bit harder to read and work with. An example:

..helper methods
..app.get extensions -http://www.sinatrarb.com/extensions.html
..error handling

You end up having to jump through hoops to register the gets,posts, helpers, etc in your extensions. To my mind, this looks like duplication of the language features we know and love in Ruby, namely the use of mixins, in the interest of providing the DSL.

<h3>Public methods and parameter defaults</h3>

To achieve similar simplicity to Sinatra's get/post/etc class methods, while making writing extensions easier there are two changes that I would make (reads: I would like to start hacking)

1. use vanilla public instance method definitions.

2. require the routes as default parameter value or provide simple route declaraions

With those two changes we can do something like the following:

..example of method definition with route default parameter.

In this way we lose the scope ambiguity. Also any public method that gets mixed in and defines a default for route will be called by that route. 

Our extensions can now look like plain old Ruby modules without any of the acrobatics required for a Sinatra extension:

..example of module inclusion of above method

Helpers can just be private methods as they would be with any normal class:

..example helper

Errors can be rescued in the normal fashion:

..rescue in a method

<h3>The inevitable downside</h3>

In my short time considering this it seems to me that the only way to register the routes as defined in the default parameters is to call each of the public instance methods defined in the app and throw an exception in the get/post/etc methods to avoid calling the method code. Not so nice. It also relies on the fact that any exceptions thrown in calls to methods by the default parameter declarations bubble up to the calling method. This makes sense, but its an implementation detail not often considered by most apps and could be changed in future versions of Ruby (who knows).
