Just picked up the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition">beta third edition</a> of this awesome book tonight and I was thoroughly enjoying even the beginning chapters. I really love the way these books have been written and my hat is most certainly off to the Sam, Dave, and David (we're not on a first name basis but if you're into rails you know who I'm talking about). 

After reading the first couple of chapters, I jumped forward to migrations as I was having trouble recently when hacking about with an app that my good friend Malcolm and I have been working on together. After a page of explanation _all_ my questions had been answered. 

It's not only exciting to get this book because it's such and awesome reference but because I have been wanting to get back to working with rails for a while now. Sorry to gush like a little school girl but you should go buy the pdf now if you are _at_all_ interested in developing with RoR.

happy hacking!
