So I finally got myself into a project I couldn't get out of and I hacked together an event tracking system I dubbed, happenings. 

As it stands now its a rails project by itself, but I would like to create a gem or plugin so that the models can easily be used by others. Some of the highlights are:

<ul>
	<li>Google maps (ym4r)</li>

	<li>Google geocode</li>
	<li>
Desktop calendar client events (.vcs)</li>
	<li>
Events, Addresses, Users, and Roles as seperate Models</li>
</ul>

That will all stay there if I ever get around to making a gem out of it but for the completed project, I also worked with:

<ul>
	<li>jQuery (effects)</li>

	<li>Prototype (calendar select)</li>

	<li>restful_authentication</li>
</ul>

It has some nice animations and I'm probably going to submit a patch to ym4r to add the :function option to the map.to_html method. Basically it let me assign a function call to the map service call so I could call it only when it was unhidden by some jquery niceness:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/24089.js"></script>

All and all very fun things. Next step since no one ever reads this blog is to unleash my master plan of an Mnesia webservice backend and datamapper adapter. MWAAHAHA!

I'll post the code for happenings soon.
