Using ruby has been an awesome experience. The expressiveness and the productivity is amazing

terse - method_missing, define_method, send, open classes, mixins

people weigh the first glance attributes, classes, object, same old,  of ruby and its relative slow execution and head another direction 

a little further in  and metaprogramming scares people, they don't see the point, and view it as the same old eval statement for yesteryear (give example from user group). One more way to have software break  and have never had the itch about the code they were writting, that little voice that said "this could be cleaner/better"

maybe its just another object oriented language, why not learn python or java/c# 

ruby developer jobs, where are they? Good amount of rails jobs, IF you have experience, but where are the "Ruby dev needed". might be a good thing, means only the motivated take up the cause

breaks old OOP paradigms closed classes

DSLs, rquery. WTF IS THIS! its crazyness, but awesome crazyness. The code becomes self documenting. You can read it an understand it more quickly. But is that a good thing? What about the programmers who come to it, and get confused because its hard to follow the execution path.

Maybe its good that only the really interested try the language out. It means there's going to be less chance of someone using the pliability of the language to do bad things


Bad programmers screw up things in very locked down languages, you can't really stop them, so why not just throw the most hindering bits to the wind (NOT GC) and at least let the competent folks have a tool they can work with. pure functions are awesome, and I love immutability, that kind of stuff doesn't really hinder you but does help prevent errors, I would love stuff like that. 

Pattern matching. Dear god if ruby had pattern matching. Game over

So much TDD/BDD everywhere, and why is that? Maybe its like I said, the good hackers like ruby, and good hackers test. Well I don't think that last is always true. More likely, the productivity that Ruby provides frees up enough time, and the testing tools are so good (Rspec) that its really painless to test. I know from my C# experience that testing was tedious, really tedious, and i think dealing with mock objects in any language can be a hassle but in Ruby everything is as unhassle as it gets.
